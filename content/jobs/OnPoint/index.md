- Researched and developed SOTA Machine Learning Models using waveform data to predict electrical network
equipment failure before time
- Conducted research to test multiple hypothesis and effectively communicated the findings to key stakeholders
- For predicting vegetation failures, improved the Balance Accuracy Score by 11% and the Precision Score for the critical class by 4% by performing feature engineering, outlier treatment, complex model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Collaborated with multivariate teams to insert trained models and gauge performance improvement
- Streamlined and optimized data analysis/visualization and data preparation pipelines using Dask, Vaex, Plotly and SHAP
