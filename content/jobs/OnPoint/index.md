-	Developed a cascaded ML model to detect failures in an electrical grid network, resulting in a 11% increase in Balanced Accuracy and a 4% increase in the Precision Score.
-	Translated business requirements into comprehensive loss functions, and utilized time series models aimed at increasing reliability, and user confidence in the ML predictions.
-	Deployed the model into production and enabled live monitoring that allowed predicting vegetation failure beforehand.
-	Optimized data preparation pipelines by leveraging Dask, resulting in a 5x reduction in computational costs.
-	Led multiple data scientists’ collaboration sessions on ‘Detecting Drift in Data’ and ‘Scaling Pandas’.
