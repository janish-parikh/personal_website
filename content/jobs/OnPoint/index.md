-  Developed a user focused cascaded ML model to detect failures in an electrical grid network, using an ensemble model and an exponential smoothening model, resulting in a 11% increase in Balanced Accuracy and a 4% increase in the Precision Score for the critical class over the existing
- Translated complex business requirements into comprehensive loss functions, and utilized exponential smoothening and other time series models aimed at increasing reliability, and user confidence in the ML predictions
- Deployed the model into production enabling live monitoring that allowed predicting vegetation failure in NZ beforehand
- Optimized the data preparation pipelines by leveraging Dask’s lazy evaluation technique, resulting in a 5x reduction in computational costs and significantly increasing the speed of data processing
- Led two data scientists’ collaboration sessions on ‘Detecting Drift in Data’ and ‘Scaling Pandas’
